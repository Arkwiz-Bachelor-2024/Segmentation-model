# Heuristic approach

# Binary grid search
# Pydensecrf outside of Scikit API meaning custom solution is needed
# Its more fitted to image segmentation
# Dataset
# 10 pictures with most uniform class distribution

# sdim, schan, compat
# 5 inference iterations as an estimate to show the impact of crf, might try 3
# 3 models for each parameter with average and upper and lower
# Upon reaching a new best model, take the average between bounds and run again

# Assumptions for starting point of potentials
# Rough estimate of smallest objects to identify meaning the dimensons of the potential impact
# has to be able to take into account objects of this size
# - Road width around 2 - 4 meters : 4 to 8 pixels
# - Tree width from 2 - 10 meters : 4 to 20 pixels

# Parameters
# sdim - The distance of pixels of influence in each axis
# schan - Impact of each channel(colors)
# compat - Weight attributed to each potential in the context of labeling
# Inference - Iterations of labeling based on potentials

# Parameter bounds
# sdims = [(3, 3), (1, 1), (5, 5)]
# schan = [(5, 5, 5), (10, 10, 10), (15, 15, 15)]
# compats = [5, 10, 15]

# # Excludes the shcan for colour differences
# sdims_options = [(3, 3), (1, 1), (5, 5)]
# compats_options = [(5, 10), (10, 10), (10, 5)]
